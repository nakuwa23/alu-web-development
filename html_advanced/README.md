# TML Semantic Structure Project

## Project Overview
This project is the **first step** in a series where we implement a webpage **from scratch** based on a designer file provided in **Figma**.  
The primary goal here is to focus **only on the HTML semantic structure** – no CSS, no styling, no JavaScript.  

By the end of this project, you will have a clean and semantic HTML document that reflects the Figma design structure and sets the foundation for styling and interactivity in later stages.

## Design Reference
- **Figma File**: [https://intranet.aluswe.com/rltoken/AvebjcsZhQIMt3DsN_fiZA]
- To access the design, make sure you:
  1. Create a free Figma account if you don’t have one.
  2. Open the provided `.fig` file or link.
  3. Click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to get full access and inspect design details.

## Requirements & Notes
- **Only HTML**: Use semantic and accessible HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- **No CSS or JavaScript**: Styling and interactivity will come in later stages.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper use of headings, alt attributes, and structural elements.
- **Fonts**: If fonts are missing in Figma, you can download them here:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
  - Spin-Cycle-OT (commercial font; use fallback if unavailable)
- **Values in Float**: Some dimensions may appear as decimals in Figma (e.g., `13.67px`). You may round these to the nearest whole number when noting structure.
